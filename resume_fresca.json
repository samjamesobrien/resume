Cassandras ordered index keys combined with a timestamp key will allow fast retrieval of messages for a given sender for a time frame and for a given receiver for a given timeframe. This optimisation due to the TRIE like structure of Cassandra nodes requires two seperate tables.\nIt is planned to perform sentiment analysis on messages post natural language processing, tokenisation and storage of TF/IDF vectors.\nMonetization strategies include premium messaging features and API exposure for the NLP and Sentiment analysis mechanisms.\nHosting will allow horizontal scaling and automation, I plan to use Digital Ocean for this project and will have to identify suitable tools at that stage.",
